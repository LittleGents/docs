# Virtual LAN

[ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/download/) is used for virtual LAN connection. As of 16/FEB/2023, the Free tier supports up to 25 nodes, which should be more than enough for us.

It provides private, unique, fixed IPs for each of us. This can be useful for gaming (e.g. MC or GMod) and collaborative development.

Our network id is `b6079f73c632a7c4`.

## Windows

Reference version: ZeroTier 1.10.3

1. Once you run the program, you should see it in the system tray at the bottom-right corner as an orange icon.

3. Enter the network id specified above.

4. Contact @shpun817 and provide your address, so that you can be authorized and identified.
